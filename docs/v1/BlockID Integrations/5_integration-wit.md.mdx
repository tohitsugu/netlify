# Integration with PingFederate
This document describes the procedure to configure the BlockID Admin Console as a passwordless authentication solution for your organization's PingFederate users. This integration will allow your users to log in to their PingFederate account leveraging their biometrics. The biometric options include Fingerprint, Voice, or Face.

### Before you Begin
You will need the following resources and privileges to complete this integration:
1. Admin access to the following:
    * BlockID Admin Console. To register, visit (link) 
    * PingFederate instance. 
2. Install on your mobile device:
    * BlockID Workforce mobile application (Compatible with iOS and Android devices). Visit the [BlockID Workforce for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onekosmos.blockid.enterprise) OR [BlockID Workforce for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blockid-workforce/id1491341550) links to download the application.

### Assumptions
* With the above pre-requisites, you should now successfully be registered and be able to log into:
   * Your organization's PingFederate instance with access to the administrative console.
   * BlockID Admin Console application. Ensure the email address used to login to the BlockID Admin Console is the same as the one used to login to PingFederate.
* Installed and registered the BlockID Workforce mobile application.
    * Ensure the email address used to login to the BlockID Workforce mobile application is the same as the one used to login to the BlockID Admin Console. 
    * Enabled biometric authentication with Fingerprint, Voice or Face Recognition options.

There are three sets of configurations that need to be performed to enable this integration:

1. Add your organization's End User application as a Service Provider (SP) within PingFederate.
2. Configure BlockID Admin Console as an Identity Provider (IDP) within PingFederate.
3. Configure PingFederate as a Service Provider (SP) within the BlockID Admin Console application.
