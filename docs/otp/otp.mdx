# OTP Authentication



BlockID one-time passcodes are a great way to add additional authentication to your login experience. Integration is simple using our SDK and only requires a few lines of code. 

BlockID one-time passcodes work with all valid email addresses. Phone numbers from most countries are currently supported. 

## **How it Works**

As part of your sign-in process, users will receive an SMS message or an email containing a one-time passcode after entering their username and password. 

Users will need to verify that one-time passcode on your application or website to complete their sign-in.

</BrowserWindow>
 

One-Time Passcodes can be sent via **[SMS](/docs/otp/request#sending-a-one-time-passcode-via-sms)** or **[Email](/docs/otp/request#sending-a-one-time-passcode-via-email)**. 

### Requirements

- BlockID SDK - installed and initialized with license key and tenant information.
- Phone number or email address you wish to send the one-time passcode to.


See [Getting Started](/docs/index#gettingstarted) for more information on installing and initializng the BlockID SDK.
